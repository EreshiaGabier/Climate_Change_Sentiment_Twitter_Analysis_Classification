## 1. General info <a class="anchor" id="general-info"></a>


This supervision machine learning project entails the analysis and prediction of Twitter users sentiment on Climate Change. It was proposed by [Explore AI](https://explore-datascience.net/) academy in November 2022 for their Advanced Classification Sprint. As this project falls under the category of classification machine learning, it therefore follows a Data Science process guide which includes:
+ Data collection
+ Exploratory data analysis
+ Data engineering
+ Model building, evaluation and deployment.

In order to carry out all the objectives for this sentiment analysis, the following necessary dependencies were loaded:
+ `Pandas` and `Numpy`
+ `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
+ `nltk`
+ `Scipy` and `Sklearn`. 

For experimentation, testing and reproducibility of the machine learning models throughout this project, the version control platform, [Comet](https://www.comet.com/site/) was implemented. Another major component of this project was to produce a Streamlit Climate Change Sentiment Analysis Application that could be used by interest parties. This project also follows a Business themed concept and therefore a PowerPoint presentation was created. This presentation highlighted the company, *Pro-Clime Solutions*, the important findings of the project and a demonstration of the Streamlit application.


## 2. Dataset <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>
The data for this classification project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/edsa-sentiment-classification/data) on the 29th November 2022. The `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets can be found in the [EDSA_Sentiment_Classification_Data](https://github.com/IkanengJack/Team-CW3/tree/main/EDSA_Sentiment_Classification_Data) folder.
